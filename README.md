# Video interview question

This repository contains a dataset:
- SST_and_CO2FLUX.nc
and a Jupyter Notebook that loads these data and performs some computation:
- Assignment.ipynb

Please address the questions in the notebook and plan to walk us through your response on the video.

The notebook requires a handful of Python packages. A suitable `conda` environment is described in 
- environment.yaml

If you are not familiar with conda, we recommend installing
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). 
You can create the `SE1_toy_problem` environment using the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
